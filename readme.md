Static assets versioning

## dropped
I was interested the first time because I didn't like most available static asset revisioning out there. Maybe I just didn't get them enough.

Anyway, I got frustrated when I wanted a CLI API, but got a JavaScript API instead.

## wip
No API exposed, and it's basically unusable.
